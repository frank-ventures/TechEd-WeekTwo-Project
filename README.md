# Week Two Project

## Project- Cookie Clicker style game!

Creating an interactive web page experience was this weeks direction, and I themed mine around coffee and caffeine.

There were three main sections to the project this week:

- The 'cookie' to click
- An incremental counter which saved locally
- Optional upgrades in a shop

Beyond that were some extra additions:

- Animations
- Personal styling
- More complex upgrades

I kept track of my thoughts and tasks here: https://frankjs.notion.site/Day-Nine-9c5ea40fad3e4b31aaacca0253e92175

### What went well

Getting the initial JavaScript code to work didn't take long thanks to the lessons and practice from this week.

I was really pleased with how the counters saved and loaded in and out of local storage, and that the counter reset worked very simply.

### A Simple Start

I started with a very basic page with very little UI aesthetics! This allowed me to focus on the JS code.

I kept my basic JS code easy-to-read, plainly naming the buttons and functions. this allowed me to follow the trail of execution after a 'button press'.

Using a little CSS let me visually seperate the page.

I realised that loading the User Stats on page load could probably be done as a "for loop" for an object. This will be a stretch implementation.

### Developing the style

I went for a theme of a cosy coffee shop for some of the page elements.

I grabbed stock images of wood from Unsplash for the backgrounds.

I utilised shared CSS classes to repeat theming across the page.

I started to use images instead of buttons to operate the JavaScript.

### Extra layers

I laid the structure in HTML and CSS for purchaseable 'upgrades'.

These will affect the 'coffee beans per second' the user gains.
