# Week Two Project

## Project- Cookie Clicker style game!

Creating an interactive web page experience was this weeks direction, and I themed mine around coffee and caffeine.

There were three main sections to the project this week:

- The 'cookie' to click
- An incremental counter which saved locally
- Optional upgrades in a shop

Beyond that were some extra additions:

- Animations
- Personal styling
- More complex upgrades

I kept track of my thoughts and tasks here: https://frankjs.notion.site/Day-Nine-9c5ea40fad3e4b31aaacca0253e92175
